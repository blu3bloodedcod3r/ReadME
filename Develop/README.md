#Professional README Generator

## Description

-  My motivation for this project was to make a README file while in the node environment.
- I built this project so that I may be able to further understand this project and use it for other items such as posting a resume online. I will be trying this as a personal project.
- This solves the problem of manually making a README file and answering questions so that the README file could be executed with your answers.
- I learned how to resolve the issues I had with this project and how to use the screenreader to record the video for this assignment.
